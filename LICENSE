This work is free to use and modify, but unless drastically changed,
attribution must be made to the original author under the name 'Crockeo'.

NON-LEGALLY BINDING PART:
  The general idea is use it however the hell you want, but just don't
  try to call it your own. Learn from it (though that's probably a bad idea
  given how piss-poor I am at this stuff), change it, masturbate to it.

  I honestly don't care so long as the ownership of it stays clear.
